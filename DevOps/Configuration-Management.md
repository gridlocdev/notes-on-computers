# Configuration Management

## Overview

To run an application, you need to configure your environment first to be able to deploy to and run the application.

Configuration is the arrangement of many things on a computing system. This includes things like OS version, application versions, what services are / should be running, etc.

To manage and provide changes to the configuration at multiple containers at once, you can use a Configuration Management tool like **Ansible**.
