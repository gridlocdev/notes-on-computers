# Containers

## Overview

Containers are lightweight environments that you create to run your software on. **Docker** is the primary tool used to manage individual containers.

There are a couple of notable but less common alternative Container tools:

- Podman (Linux)
- LXC (Supports the Ubuntu distrobution of Linux)

For the purposes of my notes, I'll look at Docker as it's the clear frontrunner used in the industry at the moment.
