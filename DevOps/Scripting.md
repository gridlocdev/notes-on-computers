# Scripting Repetitive Tasks

## Overview

DevOps engineers work closely with developers, and there are often necessary things that are repetitive to do.

Such as:

- Backups
- System Monitoring
- Cron Jobs
  - *Cron jobs are a Linux utility that schedules a command or script to run on your server automatically at a specified time and date.*

## Choosing a Language

DevOps scripts are intended to be portable, easily readable, and integrate well with the systems the tasks are being automated for. To accomplish this, most DevOps engineers choose a programming language that fits these criteria.

Some examples to look at for DevOps are:

- Python (Most popular)
- PowerShell
- BASH  
- Go
- Ruby
